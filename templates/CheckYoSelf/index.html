We dived deep into the propositions, the topic of the propositions, and the history surrounding that topic. Each partner took a side and as we learned we created our opinions and arguments. The result was a poster each partnership made in an effort to inform likely voters and share the keen awareness we had all gained. Wake up, vote, and take a look at the Ballot Measure Poster project...</p>

                                <p class="card-text">We continued this semester with the theme of checking ourselves with the election and everyday chemicals to now checking our own consumption. Students learned and investigated the science behind making the second most traded commodity in the world, coffee. They then made hot drinks for their families during Exhibition sharing what they learned about the chemistry behind making the perfect cup of coffee.  Students also researched their favorite foods and decided whether it was problematic or not based on evidence and reasoning. They wrote Op-Eds and historical fiction stories and in order to shed light on what is really in our cups, and on our plates.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Radium used to be in our watches so they could be seen at night. Which by itself wasn't deadly but would have been nice to know. What was, in fact, deadly was the direct exposure that the “Radium Girls” suffered while producing these watches. And boy did their jaws drop when they found out. Literally, because of radiation poisoning their jaws fell off. In an effort to keep our jaws, we set out to investigate the chemicals around us.</p>
